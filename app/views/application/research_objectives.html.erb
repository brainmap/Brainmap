			Our lab is part of the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and is concerned with discovering new knowledge about how the brain changes in aging, AD and related dementias. We focus on advanced PET and MRI techniques such as amyloid imaging, receptor mapping, fMRI, perfusion, and diffusion imaging to address key research questions.

		<h3>Clinically Oriented Objectives:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Detect preclinical brain changes in Alzheimer Disease that are separable from normal aging
			</li>
			<li>
				Characterize large scale brain functional and structural patterns that may be associated with outcomes such as 
				compensation or cognitive decline in neurological disorders
			</li>
			<li>
				Predict with greater certainty who will progress to dementia
			</li>
			<li>
				Support ADRC clinical and translational research in aging and dementia including development of imaging markers 
				as outcomes in treatment trials
			</li>
		</ul>
